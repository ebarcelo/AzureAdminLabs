#### Task 2: Deploy an Azure VM running Windows Server 2016 Datacenter into the existing availability set by using Azure PowerShell

1. From the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane. 

   > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching the Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command:

   ```
   $vmName = 'az1000301-vm1'
   $vmSize = 'Standard_DS1_v2'
   ```

   > **Note**: This sets the values of variables designating the Azure VM name and its size

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following commands:

   ```
   $resourceGroup = Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'az1000301-RG'
   $location = $resourceGroup.Location
   ```

   > **Note**: These commands set the values of variables designating the target resource group and its location

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following commands:

   ```
   $availabilitySet = Get-AzAvailabilitySet -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup.ResourceGroupName -Name 'az1000301-avset0'
   $vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name 'az1000301-vnet0' -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup.ResourceGroupName
   $subnetid = (Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'subnet0' -VirtualNetwork $vnet).Id
   ```

   > **Note**: These commands set the values of variables designating the availability set, virtual network, and subnet into which you will deploy the new Azure VM

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following commands:

   ```

#### Task 3: Deploy two Azure VMs running Linux into an availability set by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Create a resource** blade.

1. From the **Create a resource** blade, search Azure Marketplace for **Template deployment**.

1. Use the list of search results to navigate to the **Deploy a custom template** blade.

1. On the **Custom deployment** blade, select the **Build your own template in the editor**.

1. From the **Edit template** blade, load the template file **Labfiles\\AZ100\\Mod03\\az-100-03_azuredeploy.json**. 

   > **Note**: Review the content of the template and note that it defines deployment of two Azure VMs hosting Linux Ubuntu into an availability set and into the existing virtual network **az1000301-vnet0**.

1. Save the template and return to the **Custom deployment** blade. 

1. From the **Custom deployment** blade, navigate to the **Edit parameters** blade.

1. From the **Edit parameters** blade, load the parameters file **Labfiles\\AZ100\\Mod03\\az-100-03_azuredeploy.parameters.json**. 

1. Save the parameters and return to the **Custom deployment** blade. 

1. From the **Custom deployment** blade, initiate a template deployment with the following settings:

    - Subscription: the name of the subscription you are using in this lab

    - Resource group: the name of a new resource group **az1000302-RG**

    - Location: the same Azure region you chose earlier in this exercise

    - Vm Name Prefix: **az1000302-vm**

    - Nic Name Prefix: **az1000302-nic**

    - Image SKU: **16.04.0-LTS**

    - Vm Size: **Standard_DS1_v2**

   > **Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed to the next task. This should take about 5 minutes.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have deployed an Azure VM running Windows Server 2016 Datacenter into an availability set by using the Azure portal, deployed another Azure VM running Windows Server 2016 Datacenter into the same availability set by using Azure PowerShell, and deployed two Azure VMs running Linux Ubuntu into an availability set by using an Azure Resource Manager template.

   > **Note**: You could certainly use a template to deploy two Azure VMs hosting Windows Server 2016 datacenter in a single task (just as this was done with two Azure VMs hosting Linux Ubuntu server). The reason for deploying these Azure VMs in two separate tasks was to give you the opportunity to become familiar with both the Azure portal and Azure PowerShell-based deployments.


### Exercise 2: Configure networking settings of Azure VMs running Windows and Linux operating systems
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure static private and public IP addresses of Azure VMs

1. Connect to an Azure VM running Windows Server 2016 Datacenter via a public IP address

1. Connect to an Azure VM running Linux Ubuntu Server via a private IP address


#### Task 1: Configure static private and public IP addresses of Azure VMs

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az1000301-vm0** blade.

1. From the **az1000301-vm0** blade, navigate to the **az1000301-vm0-ip - Configuration** blade, displaying the configuration of the public IP address **az1000301-vm0-ip**, assigned to its network interface.

1. From the **az1000301-vm0-ip - Configuration** blade, change the assignment of the public IP address to **Static**.

   > **Note**: Take a note of the public IP address assigned to the network interface of **az1000301-vm0**. You will need it later in this exercise.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az1000302-vm0** blade.

1. From the **az1000302-vm0** blade, display the **az1000302-vm0 - Networking** blade.

1. From the **az1000302-vm0 - Networking** blade, navigate to the blade displaying the properties of its network interface.

1. From the blade displaying the properties of the network interface of **az1000302-vm0**, navigate to its **ipconfig1** blade.

1. On the **ipconfig1** blade, configure the private IP address to be static and set it to **10.103.0.100**.

   > **Note**: Changing the private IP address assignment requires restarting the Azure VM.

   > **Note**: It is possible to connect to Azure VMs via either statically or dynamically assigned public and private IP addresses. Choosing static IP assignment is commonly done in scenarios where these IP addresses are used in combination with IP filtering, routing, or if they are assigned to network interfaces of Azure VMs that function as DNS servers.


#### Task 2: Connect to an Azure VM running Windows Server 2016 Datacenter via a public IP address

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az1000301-vm0** blade.

1. From the **az1000301-vm0** blade, navigate to the **az1000301-vm0 - Networking** blade.

1. On the **az1000301-vm0 - Networking** blade, review the inbound port rules of the network security group assigned to the network interface of **az1000301-vm0**.

   > **Note**: The default configuration consisting of built-in rules block inbound connections from the internet (including connections via the RDP port TCP 3389)

1. Add an inbound security rule to the existing network security group with the following settings:

    - Source: **Any**

    - Source port ranges: **\***

    - Destination: **Any**

    - Destination port ranges: **3389**

    - Protocol: **TCP**

    - Action: **Allow**

    - Priority: **100**

    - Name: **AllowInternetRDPInBound**

1. In the Azure portal, display the **Overview** pane of the **az1000301-vm0** blade. 

1. From the **Overview** pane of the **az1000301-vm0** blade, generate an RDP file and use it to connect to **az1000301-vm0**.

1. When prompted, authenticate by specifying the following credentials:

    - User name: **Student**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**


#### Task 3: Connect to an Azure VM running Linux Ubuntu Server via a private IP address
 
1. Within the RDP session to **az1000301-vm0**, start **Command Prompt**.

1. From the Command Prompt, run the following:

   ```
   nslookup az1000302-vm0
   ```

1. Examine the output and note that the name resolves to the IP address you assigned in the first task of this exercise (**10.103.0.100**).

   > **Note**: This is expected. Azure provides built-in DNS name resolution within a virtual network. 

1. Within the RDP session to **az1000301-vm0**, from Server Manager, disable temporarily **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**.

1. Within the RDP session to **az1000301-vm0**, start Internet Explorer and download **putty.exe** from [**https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html**](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) 

1. Use **putty.exe** to verify that you can successfully connect to **az1000302-vm0** on its private IP address via the **SSH** protocol (TCP 22).

1. When prompted, authenticate by specifying the following values:

    - User name: **Student**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

1. Once you successfully authenticated, terminate the RDP session to **az1000301-vm0**.

1. On the lab virtual machine, in the Azure portal, navigate to the **az1000302-vm0** blade.

1. From the **az1000302-vm0** blade, navigate to the **az1000302-vm0 - Networking** blade.

1. On the **az1000302-vm0 - Networking** blade, review the inbound port rules of the network security group assigned to the network interface of **az1000301-vm0** to determine why your SSH connection via the private IP address was successsful.

   > **Note**: The default configuration consisting of built-in rules allows inbound connections within the Azure virtual network environment (including connections via the SSH port TCP 22).

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have configured static private and public IP addresses of Azure VMs, connected to an Azure VM running Windows Server 2016 Datacenter via a public IP address, and connect to an Azure VM running Linux Ubuntu Server via a private IP address


### Exercise 3: Deploy and configure Azure VM scale sets

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:
