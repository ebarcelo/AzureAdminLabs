        - URI, FQDN or IPv4: **10.203.16.4**

      > **Note**: **10.203.16.4** is the private IP address of the second Azure VM az1010301b-vm1 which you deployed to another Azure region

    - Probe Settings:

        - Protocol: **TCP**

        - Destination port: **3389**

    - Advanced settings:

        - Source port: blank

1. Wait until results of the connectivity check are returned and verify that the status is **Reachable**. Review the network path and note that the connection was direct, with no intermediate hops in between the VMs.

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you are using Network Watcher, the check can take up to 5 minutes.


#### Task 2: Test network connectivity to an Azure Storage account by using Network Watcher

1. From the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell. 

   > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching the Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to identify the IP address of the blob service endpoint of the Azure Storage account you provisioned in the previous exercise:

   ```
   [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostAddresses($(Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName 'az1010301b-RG')[0].StorageAccountName + '.blob.core.windows.net').IPAddressToString
   ```

1. Note the resulting string and, from the **Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot** blade, initiate a check with the following settings:

    - Advanced settings:

        - Source port: blank

1. Wait until results of the connectivity check are returned and verify that the status is **Reachable**. Review the network path and note that the connection was direct, with no intermediate hops in between the VMs, with minimal latency. 

    > **Note**: The connection takes place over the service endpoint you created in the previous exercise. To verify this, you will use the **Next hop** tool of Network Watcher.

1. From the **Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot** blade, navigate to the **Network Watcher - Next hop** blade and test next hop with the following settings:

        - Protocol: **TCP**

        - Destination port: **443**

    - Advanced settings:

        - Source port: blank

1. Wait until results of the connectivity check are returned and verify that the status is **Reachable**. 

    > **Note**: The connection is successful, however it is established over Internet. To verify this, you will use again the **Next hop** tool of Network Watcher.

1. From the **Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot** blade, navigate to the **Network Watcher - Next hop** blade and test next hop with the following settings:

    - Subscription: the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab
