The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Enable IP forwarding for a network interface of an Azure VM

1. Configure user defined routing 

1. Configure routing in an Azure VM running Windows Server 2016


#### Task 1: Enable IP forwarding for a network interface of an Azure VM
  
   > **Note**: Before you start this task, ensure that the template deployments you started in Exercise 0 have completed. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the second Azure VM **az1000401-vm2**.

1. From the **az1000401-vm2** blade, display its **Networking** blade.

    - Address prefix: **10.104.0.0/16**

    - Next hop type: **Virtual appliance**

    - Next hop address: **10.104.1.4**

   > **Note**: **10.104.1.4** is the IP address of the network interface of **az1000401-vm2**, which will provide service chaining between the two virtual networks.

1. From the **az1000402-rt1** blade, display its **Subnets** blade. 

1. From the **az1000402-rt1 - Subnets** blade, associate the route table **az1000402-rt1** with **subnet0** of **az1000402-vnet2**.


#### Task 3: Configure routing in an Azure VM running Windows Server 2016

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the **az1000401-vm2** Azure VM. 

1. From the **Overview** pane of the **az1000401-vm2** blade, generate an RDP file and use it to connect to **az1000401-vm2**.

1. When prompted, authenticate by specifying the following credentials:

    - User name: **Student**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az1000401-vm2**, from **Server Manager**, use the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** to add the **Remote Access** server role with the **Routing** role service and all required features. 

   > **Note**: If you receive an error message **There may be a version mismatch between this computer and the destination server or VHD** once you select the **Remote Access**  checkbox on the **Server Roles** page of the **Add Roles and Features Wizard**, clear the checkbox, click **Next**, click **Previous** and select the **Remote Access**  checkbox again.

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az1000401-vm2**, from Server Manager, start the **Routing and Remote Access** console. 

1. In the **Routing and Remote Access** console, run **Routing and Remote Access Server Setup Wizard**, use the **Custom configuration** option, enable **LAN routing**, and start **Routing and Remote Access** service.

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az1000401-vm2**, start the **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security** console and enable **File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)** inbound rule for all profiles.

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you have implemented custom routing between peered Azure virtual networks. 


### Exercise 3: Validating service chaining

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure Windows Firewall with Advanced Security on the target Azure VM

1. Test service chaining between peered virtual networks


#### Task 1: Configure Windows Firewall with Advanced Security on the target Azure VM

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the **az1000401-vm1** Azure VM. 

1. From the **Overview** pane of the **az1000401-vm1** blade, generate an RDP file and use it to connect to **az1000401-vm1**.

1. When prompted, authenticate by specifying the following credentials:

    - User name: **Student**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az1000401-vm1**, open the **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security** console and enable **File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)** inbound rule for all profiles.


#### Task 2: Test service chaining between peered virtual networks
  
1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the **az1000402-vm3** Azure VM. 

1. From the **Overview** pane of the **az1000402-vm3** blade, generate an RDP file and use it to connect to **az1000402-vm3**.

1. When prompted, authenticate by specifying the following credentials:

    - User name: **Student**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

1. Once you are connected to **az1-1000402-vm3** via the Remote Desktop session, start **Windows PowerShell**.

1. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, run the following:

   ```
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 10.104.0.4 -TraceRoute
   ```

   > **Note**: **10.104.0.4** is the IP address of the network interface of the first Azure VM **az1000401-vm1**

1. Verify that test is successful and note that the connection was routed over **10.104.1.4**

   > **Note**: Without custom routing in place, the traffic would flow directly between the two Azure VMs. 
> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have validated service chaining between peered Azure virtual networks.
