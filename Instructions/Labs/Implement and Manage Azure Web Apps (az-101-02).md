   > **Note**: Wait until the web app is created before you proceed to the next task. This should take about a minute.


#### Task 2: Create a staging deployment slot

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the newly provisioned web app. 

1. On the web app blade, use the **Browse** toolbar icon to open a new browser tab displaying the default App Service home page.

1. Close the browser tab displaying the default App Service home page.

1. In the Azure portal, from the web app blade, display its **Deployment slots** blade.

1. From the **Deployment slots** blade, add a slot with the following settings:

    - Name: **staging**

    - Configuration Source: **Don't clone configuration from an existing slot**

1. From the **Deployment slots** blade, navigate to the **staging** blade displaying the properties of the newly created deployment slot.

1. On the **staging** blade, use the **Browse** toolbar icon to open a new browser tab displaying the default App Service home page.

1. Close the browser tab displaying the default App Service home page in the staging deployment slot.


#### Task 3: Configure web app deployment settings. 

1. In the Azure portal, from the **staging blade**, display the **staging - Deployment Center** blade.

1. On the **staging - Deployment Center** blade, configure the following settings:

    - Source control: **Local Git**

    - Build provider: **App Service Kudu build server**

1. Note the resulting **Git Clone Url**. You will need in the next task of this exercise.

1. From the **Deployment Center** blade, use the **Deployment Credentials** toolbar icon to display **User Credentials** pane. 

1. In the **User Credentials** pane, set the password to **Pa55w.rd1234** and save the newly set credentials.


#### Task 4: Deploy code to the staging deployment slot and perform a slot swap

1. From the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane. 

   > **Note**:  If this is the first time you are launching the Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/php-docs-hello-world
   ```

   > **Note**: This command clones a remote repository containing a sample web app code

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command:

   ```
   Set-Location -Path $HOME/php-docs-hello-world/
   ```

   > **Note**: This command sets the current location to the newly created clone of the local repository containing the sample web app code

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command, replacing the &lt;git_clone_url&gt; placeholder with the value of the **Git Clone Url** you identified in the previous task:

   ```
   git remote add azure <git_clone_url>
   ```

   > **Note**: This command connects the local repo to the Git repo in Azure repos associated with the Azure web app

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command:

   ```
   git push azure master
   ```

   > **Note**: This command pushes the sample web app code from the local repository to the Azure web app staging deployment slot

1. When prompted, type the password **Pa55w.rd1234** you set in the previous task.

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Overview** section of the **staging** blade. 

1. On the **staging** blade, use the **Browse** toolbar icon to open a new browser tab. Note that the browser displays the **Hello World!** page you just deployed.

1. Close the browser tab displaying the **Hello World!** page.

1. On the **staging** blade, use the **Swap** toolbar icon to display the **Swap** blade.

1. On the **Swap** blade, initiate slot swap with the following settings:

    - Swap type: **swap**

    - Source: **staging**

    - Destination: **production**

    - Preview Changes: review the changes that will be applied to the destination slot

1. On the **staging** blade, use the **Browse** toolbar icon to open a new browser tab. Note that the browser displays now the default App Service home page.

1. Close the browser tab displaying the default App Service home page.

1. From the **staging** blade, display its **Deployment slots** blade.

1. From the **Deployment slots** blade, navigate back to the blade displaying the properties of the production slot of the Azure web app.

1. On the web app blade, use the **Browse** toolbar icon to open a new browser tab. Note that the browser displays the **Hello World!** page.

1. Close the browser tab displaying the **Hello World!** page.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created an Azure web app, configured web app deployment settings, created a staging deployment slot, deployed code to the staging deployment slot, and performed a slot swap.


### Exercise 2: Manage scalability and performance of Azure web apps

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure and test autoscaling of the Azure web app

1. Configure Content Delivery Network (CDN) for the Azure web app


#### Task 1: Configure and test autoscaling of the Azure web app

1. In the Azure portal, from the web app blade, display the **Scale out (App Service plan)** blade. 

1. On the web app **Scale out (App Service plan)** blade, enable autoscale with the following settings:

    - Autoscale setting name: **az1010201-AutoScaling**

    - Resource group: **az1010201-RG**

    - **Default Auto created scale condition**:
