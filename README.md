> The AZ-100 and AZ-101 certifications are being replaced by a new AZ-103 Microsoft Azure Administrator exam! You can read more about this announcement on Liberty Munsonâ€™s blog at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375217 
 
To support the new exam, we introduce a new AZ-103 GitHub repository, starting on May 3 2019. At that time, all the AZ-100 and AZ-101 labs in their respective repositories will be moved to this repository. Those labs are being reused in AZ-103 and we would like to maintain only one repository. The AZ-100 and AZ-101 lab numbering system will be retained, so if you are still teaching the AZ-100 or AZ-101 courses you will be able to easily identify the labs. You will also be able to get the latest version of the labs, and submit any issues you find.

This repository will include the following labs:

-  Azure Event Grid and Azure Logic Apps (az-101-02b)
-  Azure AD Identity Protection (az-101-04b)
-  Azure Network Watcher (az-101-03b)
-  Configure Azure DNS (az-100-04b)
-  Deploy and Manage Virtual Machines (az-100-03)
-  Governance and Compliance (az-100-01b)
-  Implement and Manage Azure Web Apps (az-101-02)
-  Implement ASR Between Regions (az-101-01)
-  Implement Directory Synchronization (az-100-05)
-  Implementing File Sync (az-100-02b)
-  Implement and Manage Storage (az-100-02)
-  Load Balancer and Traffic Manager (az-101-03)
-  Migrate On-premises Hyper-V VMs to Azure (az-101-01b)
-  Privileged Identity Management (az-101-04)
-  Role-Based Access Control (az-100-01)
-  Self-Service Password Reset (az-100-05b)
-  Virtual Machines and Scale Sets (az-100-03b)
-  VNet Peering and Service Chaining (az-100-04)

Note that the following labs will not be part of the AZ-103 course:

-  Azure Event Grid and Azure Logic Apps (az-101-02b)
-  Implement and Manage Azure Web Apps (az-101-02)
-  Migrate On-premises Hyper-V VMs to Azure (az-101-01b)
-  Privileged Identity Management (az-101-04)

**What are we doing?**

*	We are publishing the lab instructions and lab files on GitHub to allow for interaction between the course authors and MCTs. We hope this will help  keep the content current as the Azure platform changes.

*	This is a GitHub repository for the AZ-103, Microsoft Azure Administrator course. 

*	Within each repository there are lab guides in the Markdown format in the Instructions folder. If appropriate, there are also additional files that are needed to complete the lab within the Allfiles\Labfiles folder. Not every course has corresponding lab files. 

*	For each delivery, trainers should download the latest files from GitHub. Trainers should also check the Issues tab to see if other MCTs have reported any errors.  

*	Lab timing estimates are provided but trainers should check to ensure this is accurate based on the audience.

*	To do the labs you will need an internet connection and an Azure subscription. Please read the Instructor Prep Guide for more information on using the Cloud Shell. 

**How are we doing?**

*	If as you are teaching these courses, you identify areas for improvement, please use the Issues tab to provide feedback. We will periodically create new files to incorporate the changes. 

**General comments regarding the AZ-103 course**

* PowerShell scripts in all labs use the current version of Azure PowerShell Az module.

* Although not required, it is a good idea to deprovision any existing resources when you have completed each lab. This will help mitigate the risk of exceeding the default vCPU quota limits and minimize usage charges.

* Availability of Azure regions and resources in these regions depends to some extent on the type of subscription you are using. To identify Azure regions available in your subscription, refer to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/ . To identify resources available in these regions, refer to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/ . These restrictions might result in failures during template validation or template deployment, in particular when provisioning Azure VMs. If this happens, review error messages and retry deployment with a different VM size or a different region.

* When launching Azure Cloud Shell for the first time, you will likely be prompted to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, you can typically accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group. Note that this might happen again if you delete that storage account.

* Before you perform a template based deployments, you might need to register providers that handle provisioning of resource types referenced in the template. This is a one-time operation (per subscription) required when using Azure Resource Manager templates to deploy resources managed by these resource providers (if these resource providers have not been yet registered). You can perform registration from the subscription's Resource Providers blade in the Azure portal or by using Cloud Shell to run Register-AzResourceProvider PowerShell cmdlet or az provider Azure CLI command.

We hope using this GitHub repository brings a sense of collaboration to the labs and improves the overall quality of the lab experience.
