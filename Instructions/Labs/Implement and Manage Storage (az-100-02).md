   > **Note**: When not using Cloud Shell, the lab virtual machine must have the Azure PowerShell 1.2.0 module (or newer) installed [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-1.2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-1.2.0)

Lab files: 

-  **Labfiles\\AZ100\\Mod02\\az-100-02_azuredeploy.json**

-  **Labfiles\\AZ100\\Mod02\\az-100-02_azuredeploy.parameters.json**

### Scenario
  
Adatum Corporation wants to leverage Azure Storage for hosting its data

### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-  Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

-  Implement and use Azure Blob Storage

-  Implement and use Azure File Storage


### Exercise 0: Prepare the lab environment
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template


#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From the lab virtual machine, start Microsoft Edge, browse to the Azure portal at [**http://portal.azure.com**](http://portal.azure.com) and sign in by using a Microsoft account that has the Owner role in the Azure subscription you intend to use in this lab.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Subscriptions** blade.

1. From the **Subscriptions** blade, navigate to the blade displaying properties of your Azure subscription.

1. From the blade displaying the properties of your subscription, navigate to its **Resource providers** blade.

1. On the **Resource providers** blade, register the following resource providers (if these resource providers have not been yet registered):
- Microsoft.Network
- Microsoft.Compute
- Microsoft.Storage

**Note:** This step registers the Azure Resource Manager Microsoft.Network, Microsoft.Compute, and Microsoft.Storage resource providers. This is a one-time operation (per subscription) required when using Azure Resource Manager templates to deploy resources managed by these resource providers (if these resource providers have not been yet registered).

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Create a resource** blade.

1. From the **Create a resource** blade, search Azure Marketplace for **Template deployment**.

1. Use the list of search results to navigate to the **Deploy a custom template** blade.

1. On the **Custom deployment** blade, select the **Build your own template in the editor**.

1. From the **Edit template** blade, load the template file **Labfiles\\AZ100\\Mod02\\az-100-02_azuredeploy.json**. 

   > **Note**: Review the content of the template and note that it defines deployment of an Azure VM hosting Windows Server 2016 Datacenter.

1. Save the template and return to the **Custom deployment** blade. 

1. From the **Custom deployment** blade, navigate to the **Edit parameters** blade.

1. From the **Edit parameters** blade, load the parameters file **Labfiles\\AZ100\\Mod02\\az-100-02_azuredeploy.parameters.json**. 

1. Save the parameters and return to the **Custom deployment** blade. 

1. From the **Custom deployment** blade, initiate a template deployment with the following settings:

    - Subscription: the name of the subscription you are using in this lab

    - Resource group: the name of a new resource group **az1000201-RG**

    - Location: the name of the Azure region which is closest to the lab location and where you can provision Azure VMs

    - Vm Size: **Standard_DS1_v2**

    - Vm Name: **az1000201-vm1**

    - Admin Username: **Student**

    - Admin Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

    - Virtual Network Name: **az1000201-vnet1**

   > **Note**: To identify Azure regions where you can provision Azure VMs, refer to [**https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/)

   > **Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but proceed to the next exercise. You will use the virtual machine **az1000201-vm1** in the second exercise of this lab.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have initiated template deployment of an Azure VM **az1000201-vm1** that you will use in the second exercise of this lab.


### Exercise 1: Implement and use Azure Blob Storage

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create Azure Storage accounts

1. Review configuration settings of Azure Storage accounts

1. Manage Azure Storage Blob Service

1. Copy a container and blobs between Azure Storage accounts

1. Use a Shared Access Signature (SAS) key to access a blob


#### Task 1: Create Azure Storage accounts

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Create a resource** blade.

1. From the **Create a resource** blade, search Azure Marketplace for **Storage account**.

1. Use the list of search results to navigate to the **Create storage account** blade.

1. From the **Create storage account** blade, create a new storage account with the following settings: 

    - Subscription: the same subscription you selected in the previous task

    - Resource group: the name of a new resource group **az1000202-RG**

    - Storage account name: any valid, unique name between 3 and 24 characters consisting of lowercase letters and digits

    - Location: the name of the Azure region which you selected in the previous task

    - Performance: **Standard**

    - Account kind: **Storage (general purpose v1)**

    - Replication: **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**

    - Secure transfer required: **Disabled**

    - Allow access from: **All networks**

    - **Data Lake Storage Gen2** Hierarchical namespace: **Disabled**

1. Do not wait for the storage account to be provisioned but proceed to the next step.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Create a resource** blade.

1. From the **Create a resource** blade, search Azure Marketplace for **Storage account**.

1. Use the list of search results to navigate to the **Create storage account** blade.

1. From the **Create storage account** blade, create a new storage account with the following settings: 

    - Subscription: the same subscription you selected in the previous task

    - Resource group: the name of a new resource group **az1000203-RG**

    - Storage account name: any valid, unique name between 3 and 24 characters consisting of lowercase letters and digits

    - Location: the name of an Azure region different from the one you chose when creating the first storage account

    - Performance: **Standard**

    - Account kind: **Storage (general purpose v2)**

    - Access tier: **Hot**

    - Replication: **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)**

    - Secure transfer required: **Disabled**

    - Allow access from: **All networks**
    
    - **Data Lake Storage Gen2** Hierarchical namespace: **Disabled**

1. Wait for the storage account to be provisioned. This should take less than a minute.


#### Task 2: Review configuration settings of Azure Storage accounts
  
1. In Azure Portal, navigate to the blade of the first storage account you created. 

1. With your storage account blade open, review the storage account configuration in the **Overview** section, including the performance, replication, and account kind settings.

1. Display the **Access keys** blade. Note that you have the option of copying the values of storage account name, as well as the values of key1 and key2. You also have the option to regenerate each of the keys.

1. Display the **Configuration** blade of the storage account.

1. On the **Configuration** blade, note that you have the option of performing an upgrade to **General Purpose v2** account, enforcing secure transfer, and changing the replication settings to either **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)** or **Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)**. However, you cannot change the performance setting (this setting can only be assigned when the storage account is created).

1. Display the **Encryption** blade of the storage account. Note that encryption is enabled by default and that you have the option of using your own key.

   > **Note**: Do not change the configuration of the storage account. 

1. In Azure Portal, navigate to the blade of the second storage account you created. 

1. With your storage account blade open, review the storage account configuration in the **Overview** section, including the performance, replication, and account kind settings.

1. Display the **Configuration** blade of the storage account.

1. On the **Configuration** blade, note that you have the option of disabling the secure transfer requirement, setting the default access tier to **Cool**, and changing the replication settings to either **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)** or **Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)**. In this case, you also cannot change the performance setting.

1. Display the **Encryption** blade of the storage account. Note that in this case encryption is also enabled by default and that you have the option of using your own key.


#### Task 3: Manage Azure Storage Blob Service

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Blobs** blade of the first storage account. 

1. From the **Blobs** blade of the first storage account, create a new container named **az1000202-container** with the **Public access level** set to **Private (no anonymous access)**. 

1. From the **az1000202-container** blade, upload **Labfiles\\AZ100\\Mod02\\az-100-02_azuredeploy.json** and **Labfiles\\AZ100\\Mod02\\az-100-02_azuredeploy.parameters.json** into the container.


#### Task 4: Copy a container and blobs between Azure Storage accounts

1. From the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane. 

   > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching the Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following commands:

   ```
   $storageAccount1Name = (Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName 'az1000202-RG')[0].StorageAccountName
   $storageAccount2Name = (Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName 'az1000203-RG')[0].StorageAccountName
   $storageAccount1Key1 = (Get-AzStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName 'az1000202-RG' -StorageAccountName $storageAccount1Name)[0].Value
   $storageAccount2Key1 = (Get-AzStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName 'az1000203-RG' -StorageAccountName $storageAccount2Name)[0].Value
   ```

   > **Note**: These commands set the values of variables representing the names of each storage account and their corresponding keys. You will use these values to copy blobs between storage accounts by using the AZCopy command line utility in the next step.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command:

   ```
   azcopy --source https://$storageAccount1Name.blob.core.windows.net/az1000202-container/ --destination https://$storageAccount2Name.blob.core.windows.net/az1000302-container/ --source-key $storageAccount1Key1 --dest-key $storageAccount2Key1 --include "az" --sync-copy --recursive
   ```

   > **Note**: This command uses the AzCopy utility to copy the content of the container between the two storage accounts. 

1. Verify that the command returned the results confirming that the two files were transferred. 

1. Navigate to the **Blobs** blade of the second storage account and verify that it includes the entry representing the newly created **az1000202-container** and that the container includes two copied blobs.


#### Task 5: Use a Shared Access Signature (SAS) key to access a blob

1. From the **Blobs** blade of the second storage account, navigate to the container **az1000202-container**, and then open the **az-100-02_azuredeploy.json** blade.

1. On the **az-100-02_azuredeploy.json** blade, copy the value of the **URL** property.

1. Open another Microsoft Edge window and navigate to the URL you copied in the previous step. 

   > **Note**: The browser will display the **ResourceNotFound**. This is expected since the container has the **Public access level** set to **Private (no anonymous access)**.

1. On the **az-100-02_azuredeploy.json** blade, generate a shared access signature (SAS) and the corresponding URL with the following settings:

    - Permissions: **Read**

    - Start date/time: specify the current date/time in your current time zone

    - Expiry date/time: specify the date/time 24 hours ahead of the current time

    - Allowed IP addresses: leave blank

    - Allowed protocols: **HTTP**

    - Signing key: **Key 1**

1. On the **az-100-02_azuredeploy.json** blade, copy **Blob SAS URL**.

1. From the previously opened Microsoft Edge window, navigate to the URL you copied in the previous step. 

   > **Note**: This time, you will be prompted whether you want to open or save **az-100-02_azuredeploy.json**. This is expected as well, since this time you are no longer accessing the container anonymously, but instead you are using the newly generated SAS key, which is valid for the next 24 hours.

1. Close the Microsoft Edge window displaying the prompt. 

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created two Azure Storage accounts, reviewed their configuration settings, created a blob container, uploaded blobs into the container, copied the container and blobs between the storage accounts, and used a SAS key to access one of the blobs. 


### Exercise 2: Implement and use Azure File Storage

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create an Azure File Service share

1. Map a drive to the Azure File Service share from an Azure VM


#### Task 1: Create an Azure File Service share
  
1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade displaying the properties of the second storage account you created in the previous exercise.

1. From the storage account blade, display the properties of its File Service.

1. From the storage account **Files** blade, create a new file share with the following settings:

    - Name: **az10002share1**

    - Quota: **5 GB**


#### Task 2: Map a drive to the Azure File Service share from an Azure VM

   > **Note**: Before you start this task, ensure that the template deployment you started in Exercise 0 has completed. 

1. Navigate to the **az10002share1** blade and display the **Connect** blade.

1. From the **Connect** blade, copy into Clipboard the PowerShell commands that connect to the file share from a Windows computer.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az1000201-vm1** blade.

1. From the **az1000201-vm1** blade, connect to the Azure VM via the RDP protocol and, when prompted to sign in, provide the following credentials:

    - Admin Username: **Student**

    - Admin Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

1. Within the RDP session, start a Windows PowerShell ISE session. 

1. From the Windows PowerShell ISE session, open the script pane and paste into it the content of your local Clipboard.

1. Execute the script and verify that its output confirms successful mapping of the Z: drive to the Azure Storage File Service share.

1. Start File Explorer, navigate to the Z: drive and create a folder named **Folder1**.

1. In the File Explorer window, navigate to **Folder1** and create a text document named **File1.txt**. 

   > **Note**: Make sure that you take into account the default configuration of File Explorer that does not display known file extensions in order to avoid creating a file named **File1.txt.txt**.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created an Azure File Service share, mapped a drive to the file share from an Azure VM, and used File Explorer from the Azure VM to create a folder and a file in the file share.
