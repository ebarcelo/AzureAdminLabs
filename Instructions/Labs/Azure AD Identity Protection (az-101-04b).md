        - Conditions:

            - User risk: **Medium and above**

    - Controls:

        - Access: **Allow access**

        - **Require multi-factor authentication**

    - Enforce Policy: **On**


#### Task 4: Validate Azure AD Identity Protection configuration by simulating risk events

   > **Note**: Before you start this task, ensure that the template deployment you started in Exercise 0 has completed. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az1010401b-vm1** blade.

1. From the **az1010401b-vm1** blade, connect to the Azure VM via Remote Desktop session and, when prompted to sign in, provide the following credentials:

    - Admin Username: **Student**

    - Admin Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

1. Within the Remote Desktop session, open an InPrivate Internet Explorer window.

1. In the new browser window, navigate to the ToR Browser Project at [**https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en**](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en), download the ToR Browser, and install it with the default options.

1. Once the installation completes, start the ToR Browser, use the **Connect** option on the initial page, and navigate to the Application Access Panel at [**https://myapps.microsoft.com**](https://myapps.microsoft.com)

1. When prompted, sign in with the **aaduser2** account you created in the previous exercise.

1. You will be presented with the message **Your sign-in was blocked**. This is expected, since this account is not configured with multi-factor authentiation, which is required due to increased sign-in risk associated with the use of ToR Browser.

1. Use the **Sign out and sign in with a different account option** to sign in as **aaduser1** account you created and configured for multi-factor authentication in the previous exercise.

1. This time, you will be presented with the **Suspicious activity detected** message. Again, this is expected, since this account is configured with multi-factor authentiation. Considering the increased sign-in risk associated with the use of ToR Browser, you will have to use multi-factor authentication, according to the sign-in risk policy you configured in the previous task.

1. Use the **Verify** option and specify whether you want to verify your identity via text or a call. 

1. Complete the verification and ensure that you successfully signed in to the Application Access Panel.

1. Sign out as **aaduser1** and close the ToR Browser window.

1. Start Internet Explorer, browse to the Azure portal at [**http://portal.azure.com**](http://portal.azure.com) and sign in by using the Microsoft account you used to create the **AdatumLab101-4b** Azure AD tenant. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Azure AD Identity Protection - Risk events** blade and note that the entry representing **Sign-in from anonymous IP address**.

1. From the **Azure AD Identity Protection - Risk events** blade, navigate to the **Azure AD Identity Protection - Users flagged for risk** blade and note the entry representing **aaduser2**.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have enabled Azure AD Identity Protection, configured user risk policy and sign-in risk policy, as well as validated Azure AD Identity Protection configuration by simulating risk events
