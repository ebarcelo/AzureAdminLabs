### Exercise 1: Create Azure AD users and groups

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create an Azure AD user

1. Create an Azure AD security group and add the Azure AD user to the group.


#### Task 1: Create an Azure AD user

1. From the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane.

   > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching the Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following commands:

   ```
   $domainName = ((Get-AzureAdTenantDetail).VerifiedDomains)[0].Name
   $domainName
   ```

   > **Note**: These commands identify the verified DNS name of the Azure AD tenant associated with the Azure subscription you are using in this lab. Take a note of this value since you will need it later in this lab.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following commands:

   ```
   $passwordProfile = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordProfile
   $passwordProfile.Password = 'Pa55w.rd1234'
   $passwordProfile.ForceChangePasswordNextLogin = $false
   $aadUser = New-AzureADUser -AccountEnabled $true -DisplayName 'aaduser 101041' -PasswordProfile $passwordProfile -MailNickName 'aaduser101041' -UserPrincipalName "aaduser101041@$domainName"
   ```

   > **Note**: These commands create an Azure AD user which you will use later in this lab.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command:

   ```
   (Get-AzureADUser -Filter "MailNickName eq 'aaduser101041'").UserPrincipalName
   ```

   > **Note**: This command identifies the user principal name of the newly created Azure AD user. Take a note of this name. You will use it later in this lab.


#### Task 2: Create an Azure AD security group and add the Azure AD user to the group.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command:

   ```
   $aadGroup = New-AzureADGroup -Description "VM Operators" -DisplayName "VM Operators" -MailEnabled $false -SecurityEnabled $true -MailNickName "VM-Operators"
   ```

   > **Note**: This command creates an Azure AD security group

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command:

   ```
   Add-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId $aadGroup.ObjectId -RefObjectId $aadUser.ObjectId
   ```

   > **Note**: This command adds the user you created in the previous task to the newly created Azure AD group

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command:

   ```
   Get-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId $aadGroup.ObjectId
   ```
