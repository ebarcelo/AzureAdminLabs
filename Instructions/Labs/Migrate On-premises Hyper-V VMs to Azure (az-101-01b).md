### Scenario
  
Adatum Corporation wants to implement Azure Site Recovery to facilitate migration and protection of on premises Hyper-V VMs


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-  Implement Azure Site Recovery Vault

-  Configure replication of Hyper-V VMs to Azure by using Azure Site Recovery


### Exercise 1: Implement prerequisites for migration of Hyper-V VMs to Azure by using Azure Site Recovery
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Provision an Azure VM with nested virtualization support by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. Create an Azure Recovery Services vault
  

#### Task 1: Provision an Azure VM with nested virtualization support by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From the lab virtual machine, start Microsoft Edge, browse to the Azure portal at [**http://portal.azure.com**](http://portal.azure.com) and sign in by using a Microsoft account that has the Owner role in the Azure subscription you intend to use in this lab.

1. From the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell. 

   > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching the Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, upload **az-101-01b_azuredeploy.ps1**, **az-101-01b_azuredeploy.json**, **az-101-01b_azuredeploy.parameters.json**, **InstallHyperV.ps1**, and **InstallHyperV.zip** files.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following in order to copy the **InstallHyperV.ps1** and **InstallHyperV.zip** files to a DSC subfolder in the home directory.

   ```
   Set-Location -Path $HOME

   New-Item -Type Directory -Path '.\DSC'

   Move-Item -Path '.\InstallHyperV.*' -Destination '.\DSC'
   ```

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following in order to deploy a Standard_DS2_v3 Azure VM (substitute the &lt;location&gt; placeholder with the name of the Azure region where you want to perform deployment):

   ```
   ./az-101-01b_azuredeploy.ps1 -resourceGroupName 'az1010101b-RG' -resourceGroupLocation <location>
   ```

   > **Note**: To identify Azure regions where you can provision Azure VMs, refer to [**https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/)

   > **Note**: If the deployment fails due to the Standard_DS2_v3 size not being available, identify another Azure VM size that supports nested virtualization and specify this size explicitly during the deployment by using the following syntax (substitute the &lt;vm_Size&gt; placeholder with the intended Azure VM size)

   ```
   .\az-101-01b_azuredeploy.ps1 -resourceGroupName 'az1010101b-RG' -resourceGroupLocation <location> -vmSize <vm_Size>
   ```

   > **Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but proceed to the next task. You will use the virtual machine **az1010101b-vm1** in the next exercise of this lab.

#### Task 2: Implement an Azure Site Recovery vault
 
1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **New** blade.

1. From the **New** blade, search Azure Marketplace for **Backup and Site Recovery (OMS)**.

1. Use the list of search results to navigate to the **Recovery Services vault** blade.

1. Use the **Recovery Services vault** blade, to create a Site Recovery vault with the following settings:

    - Name: **vaultaz1010102bb**

    - Subscription: the same Azure subscription you used in the previous task of this exercise

    - Resource group: the name of a new resource group **az1010102b-RG**

    - Location: the same Azure region that you selected in the previous task of this exercise.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have initiated deployment of an Azure VM with nested virtualization support by using an Azure Resource Manager template and created an Azure Recovery Services vault
