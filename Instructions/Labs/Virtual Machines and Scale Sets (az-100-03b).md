1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az1000302bvmss1** blade and verify that the size of the VM instances of the VM scale set has changed.


#### Task 2: Attach data disks to the Azure VM scale set

1. From the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell. 

   > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching the Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following in order to attach one 128 GB disk to each VM instance in the VM scale set:

   ```
   $vmss = Get-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName 'az1000302b-RG' -VMScaleSetName 'az1000302bvmss1'

   Add-AzVmssDataDisk -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss -CreateOption Empty -Lun 1 -DiskSizeGB 128 -StorageAccountType 'Standard_LRS'

   Update-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName $vmss.ResourceGroupName -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss -VMScaleSetName $vmss.Name 
   ```

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az1000302bvmss1 - Storage** blade and verify that the data disk has been added. 

#### Task 3: Configure data volumes in the Azure VM scale set
 
1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following in order to configure a simple volume on the newly added disk by using Custom Script Extension:

   ```
   $vmss = Get-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName 'az1000302b-RG' -VMScaleSetName 'az1000302bvmss1'

   $publicSettings = @{"fileUris" = (,"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/compute-automation-configurations/master/prepare_vm_disks.ps1");"commandToExecute" = "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File prepare_vm_disks.ps1"}

   Add-AzVmssExtension -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss -Name "customScript" -Publisher "Microsoft.Compute" -Type "CustomScriptExtension" -TypeHandlerVersion 1.8 -Setting $publicSettings   
   
   Update-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName $vmss.ResourceGroupName -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss -VMScaleSetName $vmss.Name 
   ```

   > **Note**: To confirm that the volume has been configured, you will connect to the VM instance in the VM scale set via RDP.

1. To identify the public IP address of the Azure load balancer in front of the VM scale set, in the Azure portal, navigate to the **az1000302bvmss1** blade and note the value of the **Public IP address** entry.

1. To identify the port on which you should connect, navigate to the **az1000302b-RG** resource group blade.

1. From the **az1000302b-RG** resource group blade, navigate to the **az1000302bvmss1-lb** load balancer blade.

1. On the **az1000302bvmss1-lb** load balancer blade, note that the value of the **Public IP address** setting matches the value of the IP address used by the VM scale set you identified earlier in this task.

1. From the **az1000302bvmss1-lb** load balancer blade, navigate to the **az1000302bvmss1-lb - Inbound NAT rules** blade.

1. From the **az1000302bvmss1-lb - Inbound NAT rules** blade, navigate to the **natpool.0** blade and note that the port mappings start with **50000**. 

1. From the lab computer, initiate the Remote Desktop Connection to the first VM instance in the VM scale set by running the following from **Start -> Run** text box (where &lt;public_IP_address&gt; represents the public IP address you identified earlier in this task):

   ```
   mstsc /f /v:<public_IP_address>:50000
   ```

   > **Note**: Make sure to replace the placeholder &lt;public_IP_address&gt; with the value of the public IP address you identified earlier in this task.

1. When prompted to sign in via RDP to a VM instance of the VM scale set, provide the following credentials:

    - Admin Username: **Student**

    - Admin Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

   > **Note**: Ignore any messages regarding signing in with temporary profile. 

1. Within the RDP session, launch File Explorer and verify that the VM has an extra volume of 127 GB in size with F: drive letter assigned to it. 

1. Sign out from the RDP session.


#### Task 4: Scale horizontally compute resources of the Azure VM scale set

1. From the lab virtual machine, in the Azure portal, navigate to the **az1000302bvmss1** VM scale set blade.

1. From the **az1000302bvmss1** VM scale set blade, navigate to the **az1000302bvmss1 - Scaling** blade.

1. On the **az1000302bvmss1 - Scaling** blade, use the **Override condition** setting to increase the instance count to 2.

1. Navigate to the **az1000302bvmss1 - Instances** blade and verify that the number of instances has increased to 2.

   > **Note**: You might need to refresh the display on the **az1000302bvmss1 - Instances** blade to view the process of provisioning the additional instance.


> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have scaled vertically compute resources of the Azure VM scale set by using an Azure Resource Manager template, attached data disks to the Azure VM scale set, configured data volumes in the Azure VM scale set, and scaled horizontally compute resources of the Azure VM scale set.
